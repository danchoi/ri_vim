done:
- for dropdown: find all symbols for a class
- method search? find all classes that implement a method


to do:
- for dropdown: all classes


UI:

  There should be one universal search box

  If the user enters a capital letter, we search for Clsas

  If the user enters a lower case letter, we search for method
  - Then the user picks a classname, then we look that up

  Least important is searching for symbols in a class. There will usually be a
  class intro somewhere.

  Maybe check for .comment


If searching for method, don't autocomplete at first

ENTER to submit query, then autocomplete to select from the resutling matches?


Example of method search:

[choi kaja~/p/vim-ri]$ ruby -Ilib rivim.rb task

task             Capistrano::Configuration::Namespaces#
task             Rake::DSL#
task_call_frames Capistrano::Configuration::Execution#
task_defined?    Rake::Task::
task_help        Thor::
task_list        Capistrano::Configuration::Namespaces#
tasks            Capistrano::Configuration::Namespaces#
tasks            Rake::NameSpace#
tasks            Rake::Task::
tasks            Rake::TaskManager#
tasks            Thor::Base::ClassMethods#


Need ability to jump up to parent


[choi kaja~/p/vim-ri]$ ruby -Ilib rivim.rb Sequel::Model

Sequel::Model
Sequel::Model::Associations
Sequel::Model::Associations::AssociationDatasetMethods
Sequel::Model::Associations::AssociationReflection
Sequel::Model::Associations::ClassMethods
Sequel::Model::Associations::DatasetMethods

- need to tab complete each nesting of namespace


Almost done:

# for command line tool?

  Mabye put a period at the end if a class to look up exact name
  And if there is a method appended to a class, we can know it is an exact lookup

  - no, its easier just to use a flag


other possible tasks:
- vimscript: incremental autoocomplete with nested modules
- jump up to parent from a document
- syntax highlighting rdoc
- jump to line in code?
- open rdoc html page
- launch a google search
- search stack overflow
- dependency on a certain version of RDoc!; use 'gem' to load a specific version
- indicate if there is actually some documentation on a method or class


I wonder if ri is fast enough to autocomplete the method matches

- maybe wait until 3 characters?
