done:
- for dropdown: find all symbols for a class
- method search? find all classes that implement a method


to do:
- for dropdown: all classes


UI:

  There should be one universal search box

  If the user enters a capital letter, we search for Clsas

  If the user enters a lower case letter, we search for method
  - Then the user picks a classname, then we look that up

  Least important is searching for symbols in a class. There will usually be a
  class intro somewhere.

  Maybe check for .comment


If searching for method, don't autocomplete at first

ENTER to submit query, then autocomplete to select from the resutling matches?
